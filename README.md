1 Rahul Gandhi : The Congress showcased Rahul Gandhi as its face of future in November 2007 at its plenary session in Delhi's Talkatora Stadium. Those who were expecting him to deliver a speech like his father Rajiv Gandhi did 22 years earlier in 1985 - on the centenary of the Congress - returned home disappointed. Rahul's speech was abstract devoid of politics. Sample this: "What, after all, is poverty," Rahul Gandhi asked a delegation of about 3000 Congress workers before answering, "A poor person is one who is denied the opportunity to become rich."

The same year, 2007, came a Bollywood film titled, Pappu Paas Ho Gaya following a two-year-old TV advertisement for a chocolate brand. It tried to change the meaning attached to old Indian nickname that carried the meaning of an innocent boy to a dumb person. In 2008, another Bollywood movie had a chartbuster song, Pappu Can't Dance Sala.

2 Donald Trump : Donald Trump is the epitome of an idiot. He was a horrible president. He has been indicted on four counts and 91 crimes, and he is the front-runner for the Republican party for the 2024 election. Recently, he stated that if he becomes president again, he would be a "dictator on day 1". I guess he believes that is funny. It's not. He will always be the first syllable of that word, but he is a danger to the overall democracy of this country, and his run for the presidency is fueled by revenge and retribution.

3 Sarah Palin : I can't believe Sarah Palin isn't even on this list while you are all concentrating on Obama for being in over his head due to the mess George W. Bush left behind for him. Jimmy Carter doesn't even belong on this list, though it kinda makes sense because of how underrated he is, and Sarah Palin is probably the worst politician I have ever heard of. She based her entire economic policy off of racism, and would turn America into a living hellhole if she was ever elected.

4 George W. Bush : I'm glad George W. Bush is above Barack Obama. It just goes to show you how much this website hates Obama. At least Obama went to Harvard and has made the right choices for this country by managing foreign relations, improving our economy, and moving us forward from the recession Bush caused. He also dealt with the problems in the Middle East carefully, keeping in mind the long-term effects of his actions. All Bush did was help Africa and invade Iraq on the assumption they had WMDs, only to find they weren't there and had to use liberating Iraqis and democracy as an excuse for the invasion.

5 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez : She just doesn't make sense sometimes. She tries to look intelligent and relevant when she isn't even close to knowing what she is talking about.
